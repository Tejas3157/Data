Key challenges: longer retirement horizon, healthcare before Medicare, penalty-free access to retirement funds. \
Strategies include Roth conversion ladders, rule of 55, and substantial taxable investment accounts. \
Early retirement planning requires meticulous calculations and contingency planning for unexpected expenses.'

Cityscape with building: \
Position building at right intersection, include interesting sky or foreground at left intersection. \
